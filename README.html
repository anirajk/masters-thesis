        <P>
             You can view these files from the directory listing
             in your Web browser.  You can grab the entire
             contents from this
             <A HREF="../new-2016-04-04.zip">
                InfoZip
             </A>
             file that you should be able to unzip on any modern
             platform.
        </P>
        <P>
             The file
             <A HREF="uuthesis-2016-guide.pdf">
                 <TT>uuthesis-2016-guide.pdf</TT>
             </A>
             documents the new practices and typographical features.
             It has associated source, style, and spelling dictionary
             files as well.  A template for a new thesis can be
             trivially scraped out of those files if needed, but it
             is better to start with one of the three sample theses,
             each in its own subdirectory.  Each has its own
             <TT>Makefile</TT> to provide a from-scratch-to-PDF
             production process with a single invocation of the
             <TT>make</TT> command.  Each also has a <TT>README</TT>
             file that sketches the steps needed to compile the thesis
             into a final PDF file.
        </P>
        <P>
             The file
             <A HREF="Makefile">
                 <TT>Makefile</TT>
             </A>
             is a sample Unix Makefile for automating the handling of
             all of the steps described in the guide.  The only user
             customizations that should be necessary are the lists of
             dependent files.  Tab characters are
             <STRONG>significant</STRONG> in Makefiles, and are not
             equivalent to spaces, so do <EM>not</EM> copy their
             contents via cut-and-paste from a Web browser window:
             download the file instead!
        </P>
        <P>
             The subdirectory
             <A HREF="bibtex">
                 bibtex
             </A>
             contains all of the public BibTeX style files long
             available at the University of Utah Mathematics
             Department that are not also in recent TeX Live
             distributions.  However, you are strongly advised to
             stick with one of the basic four styles in original 1986
             LaTeX if you are to avoid formatting disputes with the
             Thesis Office.
        </P>
