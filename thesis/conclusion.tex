\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}
Section~\ref{sec:contributions} remarked the following thesis statement .

``Scale-out in-memory stores are optimized for small requests
under tight SLAs, and bulk data movement, for rebalancing and range queries, interfere;
The thesis argues \linebreak carefully leveraging data layout and advancements in modern NICs
will yield gains in performance and efficiency for large transfers in these systems
without disrupting their primary obligations.''
 

We have found conclusive evidence for this statement by evaluating the transmit performance 
of a NIC and the resource utilisation of a server while transfering large amounts of data. We 
made numerous recommendations and observations from benchmarking the NIC. We presented a client-assisted 
approach which will get better throughput without compromising resources. We analysed the effect of collocating
data in RAMCloud and benchmarked the key bottlenecks in the current migration protocol. We also proposed a set of design 
guidelines for a new migration protocol for RAMCloud drawing lessons from observing the NIC closely while it was 
transferring gigabytes of data. 

While evaluating the various RDMA primitives, we found that one-sided RDMA verbs, though they offload destination CPU, 
require additional acknowledgement mechanisms. We also found that client initiated \cpp{READ}s cannot use the 
scatter gather DMA engine effectively. We arrived at the conclusion that \cpp{SEND} primitives 
are the most suited for returning scattered set of records.

We analysed the transmission throughput of Zero Copy and Copy Out for 128~B records and found that Bigger records can saturate the NIC.
Zero Copy is significantly faster for bigger chunks. Zero Copy is also limited by the length of S/G list for small 128~B records.
We also found that Copy Out can perform better if you have more records. We arrived at the following conclusion that 
unless your records are small and scattered, always use Zero Copy, for small and scattered records, you might need to tune your layout 
to get Zero Copy advantage.

Zero Copy with two-sided RDMA promises CPU savings by offloading CPU from the critical data transfer path of the sender. We found that 
CPU overheads in transmissions are largely due to the additional copies involved in Copy Out and Zero Copy benefits from avoiding the extra copy.
 
CPU Efficiency of transmission is better measured in cycles spent per transmitted byte. We see that even transmitting two records at a time makes 
Zero Copy more CPU efficient in transmission and the gains get bigger for bigger transmissions.

Memory bandwidth is a crucial resource in an in-memory database server bound by DRAM capacity and latency. We found that for transfer of large 
records, the pressure on the memory controller is approximately 2X the transmission throughput and while transmitting at the line rate of our NIC, 
the server consumed half of all available memory bandwidth. If memory bandwidth is not an expendable resource, we ascertain that the designer should 
always use Zero Copy.
  
Intel\textregistered's recent micro-architectures has support for DDIO which treats LLC as the source and destination for I/O transfers. This has significant impact on 
the memory pressure exerted to the system, especially for Copy Out. DDIO paints a slightly different picture favoring Copy Out since the cost of pre-fetching the data is 
paid up front, we don't incur additional misses from DDIO. This is less relevant in the bigger scheme of things and Zero Copy still wins in terms of total 
consumed memory bandwidth in the server
  
The transmission throughput anomaly where throughput of Zero Copy is limited while transferring a large set of small scattered records is best explained to 
our knowledge with PCIe errors tapering off with 16 records per transmission.
 
We argued for a client assisted design with no-update-in-place records that can gain the benefits of Zero Copy while retaining the transmission throughput of larger records. 
We get a 50\% reduction in memory bandwidth consumption using this approach without compromising transmission throughput. 
No updates in place and latch and lock freedom makes this approach clearly favorable for the modern NIC. 

We also laid out the basic design for a new migration protocol in RAMCloud which makes use of Zero Copy, smart layout for transmission and bypassing re-replication using 
RDMA.

\section{Future Directions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Investigate and build more hybrid data structures for Zero Copy; we saw how a lock and latch free data structure that can support no update-in-place 
fits well with the NIC's Zero Copy structure. While we employed a similar structure in our benchmark to show the benefits, there is a lot of complexity associated 
with a full implementation of such a structure. It should also be mentioned that there may be other structures that are uniquely capable of exploiting the modern NIC's 
performance characteristics.
\item Evaluate impact on column stores;we discuss the possible impact of column stores and how the row-oriented result format might cause problems doing Zero Copy. We need 
to actually measure the transmit performance and resource impact for a complete implementation of a column oriented, in-memory database.
\item Analyse throughput anomaly for small records in depth;while DRAM traffic resulting from PCIe errors correlates with the performance dip observed in Zero Copy, 
they don't explain why this happens for exactly when we transmit 2048~B (16 records). There needs to be a more detailed analysis around this dimension.
\item Build an actual migration protocol for RAMCloud;the set of guidelines provided in the thesis only serves as a reference point, there would be significant challenges 
in actual implementation of a migration protocol for a complex system such as RAMCloud where we may also need to generalise the protocol for older network hardware for backward 
compatibility.
\item Evaluation of a wider variety of NICs; we based all of our experiments on Mellanox Infiniband ConnectX-3\textregistered NICs, At the time of writing, Mellanox has already 
released plans of releasing NICs that offer 4$\times$ maximum throughput and latencies of a few hundred nanoseconds. The scatter gather length of 32 was an important constant in 
all our observations, it would be interesting to note how the behaviour of the system will change with a scatter-gather list of a different length. We also need to draw parallel 
conclusions for other advanced NICs which may not explicitly support S/G DMA like the mellanox hardware.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Lessons Learned}
We started out to measure the impact of data layout and pre-aggregation on network transmit performance. 
It was rewarding to explore the complexities of handling kernel by-pass over the infiniband library and 
scoreboarding in a multi threaded environment to arrive at the right measurements for transmission.
It was also challenging to profile the code for additional metrics reflecting system resource consumption 
without disrupting the actual transmissions. 

I learned a lot while developing many portions of this benchmark. My most important takeaway from this work 
is the virtue of having truly repeatable experiments. Having hardware environments which are set up to encourage 
repeatable research and the seemingly disproportionate amount of time spent on developing the tooling of the 
framework certainly helped in this regard, especially for comparing results after code modifications and root-cause analysis.
I got first hand experience in concurrent programming, use of Infiniband verbs, RDMA and accurate cycle counting 
for profiling wall time. I have significantly improved my scripting and documentation skills over the course of this work. 
I have also learned valuable lessons on team work and collaboration and received a lot of help from my 
advisor and peers over the course of the work. I believe the guidelines that we drew from this work will 
enable researchers of the future with better performing in memory databases for large transfers. 

\section{Parting thoughts}
Today's database designer has to navigate a complex, multi-dimensional space of trade offs and network transmission 
is a critical aspect of performance for the distributed, scale out stores of tomorrow. Smart layout of data and  
co-designing for hardware are paramount in extracting maximum network performance without consuming 
unnecessary system resources. The use of Zero Copy offers better transmission throughput and memory bandwidth utilisation for 
large transfers if we carefully co-design the software keeping the network hardware in mind. Research on how to extract 
more transmission performance from column oriented layouts and advanced indexing structures should continue until we bridge the 
gap between what a modern distributed database server can deliver and what the hardware, especially fast networks is capable of doing.
