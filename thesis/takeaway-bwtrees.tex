  \textbf{Takeaways: Client-Assisted Design with Delta Records}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use of a large enough base page and updates as delta records helps in saturating NIC's transmission throughput.
  \item We get a 50\% reduction in memory bandwidth consumption using this approach without compromising transmission throughput.
  \item No updates in place and latch and lock freedom makes this approach clearly favorable for the modern NIC. 
  \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Recommendation}: \textbf{Novel data structures can significantly influence the performance of a modern NIC}; To extract maximum performance from the NIC without compromising system resources, make use of client-assisted designs using lock-free structures that offer no updates in place.\label{takeaway:impact-bwtrees}
