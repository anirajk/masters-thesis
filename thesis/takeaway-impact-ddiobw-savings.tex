  \textbf{Takeaways: Copy Out side effects of DDIO}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The additional \memcpy ~ step prefetches data to LLC at a cost and improves the number of DDIO misses that result in DRAM accesses. 
  \item If not for the DDIO effects, we would have seen a bigger drop in throughput and memory efficiency for Copy Out. 
  \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Recommendation}: DDIO paints a slightly different picture of memory consumption favoring Copy Out; in the bigger scheme of things, total memory bandwidth consumed still makes us prefer Zero Copy. \label{takeaway:impact-ddiobw-savings}
