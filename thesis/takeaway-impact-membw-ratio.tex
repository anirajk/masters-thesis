  \textbf{Takeaways: Efficiency of Memory Bandwidth Utilization}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Any use of Copy Out is pure overhead; smaller records doing Zero Copy have larger memory footprint owing to the descriptor overhead.
  \item There are cases where Zero Copy and Copy Out show similar memory bandwidth efficiency of transmission; Copy Out of smaller records have bigger footprint though inconsistent across transmission sizes.
  \item Chapter~\ref{chap:applications} discusses a hybrid approach yielding better throughput without consuming as much memory bandwidth.
  \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Recommendation}: If efficient use of memory bandwidth is a concern, always use Zero Copy.\label{takeaway:impact-membw-ratio}
