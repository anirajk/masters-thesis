  \textbf{Takeaways: Throughput}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Bigger records can saturate the NIC; Zero Copy is significantly faster for bigger chunks.
  \item Zero Copy is limited by the length of S/G list; Zero Copy can't saturate the NIC transmitting 128~B records.
  \item Copy out can be faster for smaller records unless S/G length {\em is carefully tuned}; we examine Copy Out's efficiency in Section ~\ref{sec:overhead}.
  \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Recommendation}: For large sets of small, scattered records, use Copy Out. If your record sizes are bigger, always use Zero Copy. \label{takeaway:tput}
