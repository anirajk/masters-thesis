  \textbf{Takeaways: Verbs}
  \begin{enumerate}
 \item \cpp{SEND} saturates NIC; can gather records and notify receiver when transmission completes.
 \item \cpp{WRITE} avoids invoking receiver; server must induce notifications some other way.
 \item \cpp{READ} is client initiated and avoids the server CPU in critical path; it's the lowest overhead on server,
  but can collect one contigous chunk per posted op, limiting its usefulness for returning complex responses.
  \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Recommendation}: Use \cpp{SEND} primitives for returning scattered set of records. \label{takeaway:verbs}
