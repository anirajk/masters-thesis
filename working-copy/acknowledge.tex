I consider myself fortunate in many walks of life and thank God profusely for that. Among all the people that I could thank for every single achievement in my life, my gratitude for my parents, Kesavan MP 
and Sarala Kesavan, surpasses the rest. I have come to realize that the luckiest I have ever been was to be born to my parents who dedicated their entire lives to the betterment of mine in the face of financial hardships and social stigma. They instilled in me the value of education from early years. No statement of acknowledgment would be complete without thanking them.

I owe everything I have learned and accomplished as a graduate student at the U to Ryan Stutsman. Ryan was the rock of my master's education, and if not for his steadfast mentoring and confidence in me despite my inherent skepticism, this work would not have been possible. Ryan has been a great mentor, advisor and instructor and his positivity and unparalleled work ethic inspired me to go the extra mile to complete the tasks. He is humble despite his numerous accomplishments and his empathy and generousness went a long way to my success here. I consider myself privileged to have been one of the first students that graduated under him.

Robert Ricci is the sole reason I decided to attend the U, and no one has been more encouraging to me than Rob during the last two years. He showed me the ways of graduate school and
was the driving factor that kept me on track of my progress. I could always walk up to his office to get answers for both e. Since the first email up until my thesis defense, Rob was instrumental in my master's education, and he is someone I can look up to for wisdom anytime. I would also like to thank Feifei Li for sitting on my thesis committee. Despite his busy schedule, Feifei found time to discuss my work and gave indispensable advice both about graduate school and about pursuing a career in Computer Science.

I only wish that I had met Chinmay Kulkarni earlier. There couldn't have been a better labmate I could ask for, and  I have learned a lot from you over the short time we have worked together. I'm sure you will work out wonders in our group, and I look forward to your successful academic career. I would also like to thank Candy and QingKai for their help and support in this material. Graduate school would have been a lot different if not for my roommates and longtime friends, Alex Karathra and Rony Gregory. I thank them for all their encouragements and support.

I have made plenty of decisions in my brief academic and professional career and attending the University of Utah was the single most rewarding decision that I have made till now. Like any other student, I have had the pleasure of expanding my horizon of knowledge exponentially after every stage of my education. I would like to thank my teachers from my early schooling days at Vijayamatha and  T.H.S.S and later at Govt. Model Engineering College. I would like to thank my mentors at Zynga and Dreamworks who have encouraged me a lot to push harder and move forward.
