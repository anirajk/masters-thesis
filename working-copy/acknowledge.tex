Among all the people that I could thank for every single achievement in my life,
my gratitude for my parents stands out from the rest. I consider myself fortunate
in life in many regards and thank God profusely for that, but I have come to realise
that the luckiest I have ever been is to be born to parents who dedicated their 
entire lives to the betterment of mine and braving financial hardships and social
stigma, instilled in me the value of education from early years. No statement of 
acknowledgment without thanking them.

I owe everything I have learned and accomplished as a graduate student at 
the U to Ryan Stutsman. Ryan was the rock of my master's education and if not for his  constant mentoring
and confidence in me despite my skepticism, this thesis would not have been possible.
Ryan has been a great mentor, advisor and instructor and his positivity  and 
unparallel work ethic inspired me to go the extra mile to get behind this work.
He is humble despite his many accomplishments and his empathy and generousness were 
the key ingredients of my success here. I consider myself privileged to have been
one of the first students that graduated under him.

Robert Ricci is the sole reason I attended the U and no one has been more encouraging
to me than Rob during the last two years. He was engaging from early days and I could
walk up to him whenever I was in doubt


I have made plenty of decisions in my brief academic and professional
career and attending University of Utah was the single most rewarding decision 
that I have made till now. Like any other student, I have had the pleasure of 
expanding my horizon of knowledge exponentially after every stage of my education.
I would like to thank my teachers from Vijayamatha School and at T.H.S.S Vattamkulam
for delighting me with the fundamentals of education.
