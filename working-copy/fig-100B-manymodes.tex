\caption{The green dot shows the performance for RDMA reads which is also unfair
since RDMA reads can only transmit a single record at a time. The yellow dot
shows RDMA write performance. The modes shown was an enum of the format 
\cpp{enum Mode { MODE_SEND, MODE_WRITE, MODE_READ}}
\cpp{<infiniband/verbs.h> supports the various modes}
