\chapter{Evaluation}

We explored hows the different designs trade-off database server efficiency and
performance, by building a simple model of an in-memory database system that
concentrates on data transfer rather than full query processing. In all experiments,
one node acts as a server and transmits results to 15 client nodes.
Our experiments were run on the Apt~\cite{Ricci+:OSR15} cluster of the
CloudLab~\cite{Cloudlab:URL} testbed: this testbed provides exclusive bare-metal
access to a large number of machines with RDMA-capable Infiniband NICs.

Table~\ref{tbl:config} shows the Experiment Setup for the cluster where we profiled
the Mellanox Infiniband ConnectX-3\textregistered NIC and impact of data layout and 
use of no update in place structures on transmission throughput. The cluster has 7
Mellanox SX6036G FDR switches arranged in two layers. The switching fabric is
oversubscribed and provides about 16~Gbps of bisection bandwidth per node
when congested.
