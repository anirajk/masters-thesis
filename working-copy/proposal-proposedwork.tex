\chapter{Proposed Work}

This is a forward looking section listing out a few experiments that will
strengthen the thesis and pave way for a fast and efficient migration protocol.
We need to find conclusive evidence about the impact of synchronization and 
advanced caching mechanism on our experiments. The synchronisation primitives 
that are used in the microbenchmarks should not have a driving effect to the 
conclusions we make from them. This includes fully investigating the impact
of DDIO~\cite{ddio} ad well as coming up with uncore and off-core performance
measurements to pinpoint the areas of contention while transmitting huge blocks
of data.

We also need to motivate the need for a fast and efficient migration protocol 
by virtue of analysing and presenting the current bottlenecks. This would entail
setting up the experiments showing data migration of RAMCloud using the latest 
protocol and analysing and finding pain points that hamper performance. There needs
to be another experiment too which measures the impact of indexes in migration 
for change in load and skew on indexed reads in a system such as RAMCloud. We are
hopeful that it will provide interesting insights on data locality.

\section{Timeline}

Table~\ref{tbl:config} shows the expected amount of work that needs to be done 
in the coming months to conclusively gather evidences that support the thesis. 
This will also serve as the schedule guideline for the rest of my program.


\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Till Fall 2016}:} We have evaluated how modern NIC impacts data layout 
and concurrency by developing a microbenchmark and measuring throughput and cpu 
impact while transmitting huge amounts of data. We compared how scatter gather DMA 
and the traditional copy impacts throughput varying record sizes and layout. 

\item{\textbf{Fall 2016 - Spring 2017}:} We have to explore the impacts of Intel\textregistered 
DDIO~\cite{ddio} technology which makes the last level cache the primary source and 
destination memory for the NICs. We need to do this in the context of thread local 
buffers to conclude the effect of modern NICs. We also need to set up a few experiments
that will motivate fast and efficient migration protocol. This would involve 
setting up migrations involving huge amount of data and measuring it's impact on overall throughput
and experiments where it can be proved that SLAs of the system are violated as an effect of migration.
One such possible experiment is to split and migrate a hot index table which has it's 
records spanning multiple files. Other possible experiments include measuring the 
impact of distributed recovery on locality, scaling a cluster up and down and measuring
difference in performance characteristics, shifting $\theta$ on a workload which follows 
Zipfian distribution etc.
