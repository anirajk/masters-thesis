\section{Timeline}

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Till Fall 2016}:} We have evaluated how modern NIC impacts data layout 
and concurrency by developing a microbenchmark and measuring throughput and cpu 
impact while transmitting huge amounts of data. We compared how scatter gather DMA 
and the traditional copy impacts throughput varying record sizes and layout. 

\item{\textbf{Spring 2016}:} We have to explore the impacts of Intel\textregistered 
DDIO~\cite{ddio} technology which makes the last level cache the primary source and 
destination memory for the NICs. We need to do this in the context of thread local 
buffers to conclude the effect of modern NICs.

We also need to set up a few experiments that will motivate
