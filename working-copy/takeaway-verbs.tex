  \textbf{Takeaways: Verbs}
  \begin{enumerate}
 \item \cpp{SEND} saturates NIC; Can gather records and notify receiver when transmission completes.
 \item \cpp{WRITE} avoids invoking receiver; Server should induce notifications some other way.
 \item \cpp{READ} is client initiated; It's the lowest overhead on server,
  but can only collect one contigous chunk per posted op limiting it's usefulness for returning complex responses.
  \end{enumerate}
  \textbf{Recommendation}: Use \cpp{SEND} RDMA verbs for returning scattered set of records \label{takeaway:verbs}
